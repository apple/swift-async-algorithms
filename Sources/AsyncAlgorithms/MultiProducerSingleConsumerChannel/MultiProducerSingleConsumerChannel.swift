/// ``MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel/Source``.

/// A multi producer single consumer channel.
///
/// The ``MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel`` provides a ``MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel/Source`` to
/// send values to the channel. The source exposes the internal backpressure of the asynchronous sequence to the
/// producer. Additionally, the source can be used from synchronous and asynchronous contexts.
///
///
/// ## Using a MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel
///
/// To use a ``MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel`` you have to create a new channel with it's source first by calling
/// the ``MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel/makeChannel(of:throwing:BackpressureStrategy:)`` method.
/// Afterwards, you can pass the source to the producer and the channel to the consumer.
///
/// ```
/// let (channel, source) = MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel<Int, Never>.makeChannel(
///     backpressureStrategy: .watermark(low: 2, high: 4)
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ### Asynchronous producers
///
/// Values can be send to the source from asynchronous contexts using ``MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel/Source/send(_:)-9b5do``
/// and ``MultiProducerSingleConsumerChannel/Source/send(contentsOf:)-4myrz``. Backpressure results in calls
/// to the `send` methods to be suspended. Once more elements should be produced the `send` methods will be resumed.
///
/// ```
/// try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
///     group.addTask {
///         try await source.send(1)
///         try await source.send(2)
///         try await source.send(3)
///     }
///
///     for await element in channel {
///         print(element)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Synchronous producers
///
/// Values can also be send to the source from synchronous context. Backpressure is also exposed on the synchronous contexts; however,
/// it is up to the caller to decide how to properly translate the backpressure to underlying producer e.g. by blocking the thread.
///
/// ##Â Finishing the source
///
