# ``AsyncAlgorithms``

**Swift Async Algorithms** is an open-source package of asynchronous sequence and advanced algorithms that involve concurrency, along with their related types.

## Overview

This package has three main goals:

- First-class integration with `async/await`
- Provide a home for time-based algorithms
- Be cross-platform and open source
