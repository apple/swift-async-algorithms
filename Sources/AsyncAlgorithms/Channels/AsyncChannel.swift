/// A channel for sending elements from one task to another with back pressure.
///
/// The `AsyncChannel` class is intended to be used as a communication type between tasks,
/// particularly when one task produces values and another task consumes those values. The back
/// pressure applied by `send(_:)` via the suspension/resume ensures that
/// the production of values does not exceed the consumption of values from iteration. This method
/// suspends after enqueuing the event and is resumed when the next call to `next()`
/// on the `Iterator` is made, or when `finish()` is called from another Task.
/// As `finish()` induces a terminal state, there is no more need for a back pressure management.
/// This function does not suspend and will finish all the pending iterations.
