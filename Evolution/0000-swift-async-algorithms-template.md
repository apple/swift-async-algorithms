## Introduction

A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a
single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what
problem this proposal is addressing.

Swift forums thread: [Discussion thread topic for that proposal](https://forums.swift.org/)

## Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the
problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show
how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its
drawbacks. If it's completely new functionality that cannot be
emulated, motivate why this new functionality would help Swift
developers create better Swift code.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe
how they work. Show how your solution is better than current
workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new
syntax in the language, show the additions and changes to the Swift
grammar. If it's a new API, show the full API and its documentation
comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be
sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to
reasonably implement the feature.

## Effect on API resilience

API resilience describes the changes one can make to a public API
without breaking its ABI. Does this proposal introduce features that
would become part of a public API? If so, what kinds of changes can be
made without breaking ABI? Can this feature be added/removed without
breaking ABI? For more information about the resilience model, see the
[library evolution
document](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/LibraryEvolution.rst)
in the Swift repository.

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and
why you chose this approach instead.

## Acknowledgments

If significant changes or improvements suggested by members of the 
community were incorporated into the proposal as it developed, take a
moment here to thank them for their contributions. Swift evolution is a 
collaborative process, and everyone's input should receive recognition!
